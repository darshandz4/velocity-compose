services:
  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: yourpassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: yourdatabase
      MYSQL_USER: youruser

In this example, we're using version 3.9 of Docker Compose. We're creating a service called db, which uses the mysql:8.0 Docker image.
We're also setting some environment variables, including the root password, database name, user, and password.

We're mapping port 3306 on the container to port 3306 on the host machine, so that you can access the MySQL server from outside the Docker container. 
We're also creating a volume named data, which maps to the /var/lib/mysql directory inside the container.
This volume will persist data even if the container is removed.

You can save this file as docker-compose.yml in a directory, and then run the command docker-compose up to start the MySQL server.
